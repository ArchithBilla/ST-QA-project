## <a name="_clpkcm4wy6a5"></a>INTRODUCTION
An Integration testing process where individual units are combined and tested as a group.the purpose of this testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units test plan is custom home page and pagination is web page is designed and developed specifically for particular website a document that outlines the process,scope and objectives of integration testing the following are some of the key components of an integration testing.pagination is technique used in web design to break long lists or set of data into smaller,more manageable pages and pagination helps to improve the user experience by reducing the amount of scrolling required to view content and by making it easier to find specific items in a long list.

## <a name="_2ytbx6gtxspp"></a>Objectives
